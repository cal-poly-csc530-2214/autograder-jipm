We wrote generateMPY function that generated MPy files to feed to sketch translator based on our EML rules. The function takes the expression to work one and assumes  it's in correct syntax. For the simplicity, our rule in the function was to simply leave the code as is, add 1, or subtract 1. This was for the proof of the concept to get the sketch working.
